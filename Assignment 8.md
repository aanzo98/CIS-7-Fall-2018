The video that I found most helpful to me was the video on Reccurance because it was the concept that I had the most difficult grasping.
In the video, TrevTutor used simple examples with basic number sequences and visually explained how each number 
corresponded with the variable 'n' in the formula. It was straight forward and especially helpful because the few examples he showed 
included the recursion technique and was slightly more difficult than the last example but still within my ability to understand, 
to an extent. But most of all, this video was the most helpful to me becaue it emphasized how important theis concept was, 
and understanding it became that much more clear to me from the way he used examples, illustrated it, and talked at a reasonable pace.
